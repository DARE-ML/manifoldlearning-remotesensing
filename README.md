# Manifold Learning in Remote Sensing data processing

This repository provides supplementary materials for the paper entitled 'Enhancing remote sensing data clustering through a comprehensive evaluation of manifold learning methods'. This paper comapres the efficiency of different manifold learning methods including t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE), Isomap Embedding, Spectral Embedding (Laplacian Eigenmaps), Modified Locally Linear Embedding (Modified LLE), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for reducing the dimensionality of the feature space of a well-known dataset, i.e., Indian Pines.
